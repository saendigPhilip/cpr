# You may need to patch CMakeLists.txt to set the library install path to be:

#+install(TARGETS <sharedlibname> LIBRARY DESTINATION lib/${CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE})

# Multiarch package requires library files to be installed to
# /usr/lib/<triplet>/ .  If the build system does not support
# $(DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH), you may need to override some targets such as
# dh_auto_configure or dh_auto_install to use $(DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH) .
